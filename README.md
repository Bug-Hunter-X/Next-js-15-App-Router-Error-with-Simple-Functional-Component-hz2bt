# Next.js 15 App Router Error with Simple Functional Component

This repository demonstrates a strange error encountered when using a basic functional component within the `pages` directory of a Next.js 15 application using the app router.  The error message provided by Next.js is not very informative, making debugging difficult.

## Bug Report

The issue arises from a seemingly innocuous functional component.  Despite the simplicity of the code, Next.js throws an error during the build or runtime.

## Steps to Reproduce

1.  Create a new Next.js 15 app:
    ```bash
    npx create-next-app my-app --typescript --use-app-dir
    ```
2.  Replace the contents of `pages/index.js` with the code found in `bug.js`.
3.  Attempt to run the application using `npm run dev`.

## Expected Behavior

The application should render the "Hello" message without errors.

## Actual Behavior

Next.js throws an unhelpful error, often related to rendering or routing issues.

## Solution (See `bugSolution.js`)

The solution to this issue appears to involve a change that should be minimal and not needed for the simplest functional component. Further investigation is needed to understand why this occurs.
